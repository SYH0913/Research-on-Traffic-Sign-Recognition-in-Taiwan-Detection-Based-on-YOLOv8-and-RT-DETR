### 摘要 | Abstract

隨著交通工具的普及和道路交通量的不斷增加，交通安全問題越來越受到關注，本研究旨在研發一個能夠即時辨識之交通號誌的系統，並具體實際運用於交通載具上，期望能在道路安全領域上提供研究貢獻。  

With the popularization of vehicles and the continuous increase in road traffic, traffic safety issues have received more attention. This study aims to develop a system that can recognize traffic signs in real time and be practically applied to vehicles, hoping to contribute to road safety research.

本研究提出「基於YOLOv8和RT-DETR應用於臺灣交通號誌辨識之研究」，主要針對臺灣地區的限速相關交通號誌進行辨識，建立包含不同角度、距離、光線、天氣等多種情況的交通號誌資料集，以訓練YOLOv8和RT-DETR之系列模型，從中探究模型的訓練結果，並結合樹莓派硬體設備進行實際路況的測試與驗證，探討在實際場景中的應用，並提出相關的建議和改進措施。  

This study proposes "Research on Traffic Sign Recognition in Taiwan Based on YOLOv8 and RT-DETR", focusing on the recognition of speed limit related traffic signs in Taiwan. A dataset including various conditions such as different angles, distances, lighting, and weather was established to train YOLOv8 and RT-DETR series models. The training results of the models were explored, and practical road tests and verifications were carried out with Raspberry Pi hardware to investigate real-world applications and propose relevant suggestions and improvements.

本研究採用精確率(Precision)、召回率(Recall)、mAP@50、mAP@50-95、F1信賴度(F1-Confidence)作為評估指標，根據研究結果顯示，模型能夠有效地識別臺灣地區的限速相關交通號誌。此外，本研究進行了對比實驗，結果顯示YOLOv8系列模型的辨識效果優於RT-DETR系列模型的辨識結果。  

This study uses Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95, and F1-Confidence as evaluation indicators. The results show that the models can effectively recognize speed limit related traffic signs in Taiwan. Furthermore, comparative experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that the recognition performance of YOLOv8 series models is superior to that of RT-DETR series models.
